# JSON to Figma Styles

**Sync your design tokens with Figma in seconds**

## What is this plugin?

Convert your design tokens from JSON format into native Figma styles automatically. This plugin helps you maintain consistency between your codebase and design files by importing color palettes, typography, effects, and grid systems directly into Figma.

## What can you do with it?

- **Import Paint Styles**: Convert color tokens (solid colors and gradients) into Figma paint styles
- **Import Text Styles**: Transform typography tokens into Figma text styles with fonts, sizes, line heights, and more
- **Import Effect Styles**: Create shadow and blur effects from your design system
- **Import Grid Styles**: Set up layout grids based on your grid system specifications

## Tips

‚úÖ **Organize with naming**: Use forward slashes (/) in style names to create organized folders (e.g., "Brand/Primary/Blue")

‚úÖ **Update safely**: The plugin will update existing styles with matching names, so you can re-import to sync changes

‚úÖ **Start small**: Test with a few styles first to make sure your JSON structure is correct

‚úÖ **Check fonts**: Make sure all fonts referenced in textStyles are available in Figma
